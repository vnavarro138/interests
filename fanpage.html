    <h2>Bio</h2>

    <p>
        The Smashing Pumpkins are an American alternative rock band from Chicago, Illinois, formed in 1988. Disavowing the punk rock roots of many of their alt-rock contemporaries, they have a diverse, densely layered, and guitar-heavy sound, containing elements of gothic rock, heavy metal, dream pop, psychedelic rock,progressive rock, shoegazing, and electronica in later recordings. Corgan is the group's primary songwriterâ€”his grand musical ambitions and cathartic lyrics have shaped the band's albums and songs, which have been described as "anguished, bruised reports from Billy Corgan's nightmare-land".
